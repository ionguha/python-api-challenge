# WeatherPy
## Visualizing the weather of 500+ cities across the world with varying distance from the equator. 
 * A python library **_CityPy_** was used to search for nearest cities with randomly generated coordinates
 * Weather data for each city was collected by making API calls to **_OpenWeatherMap_**
 * Scatter plots *using a function* for **_Maximum Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed vs. Latitude_**
 * Selected cities are saved as .csv files in **_Output_Data_** folder
 * Linear Regression plots *using a function* for the same parameters in Northern & Southern Hemispheres
 * Plots are saved as .png file in **_Output_Data_** folder
 * A report of the study is available as **_WeatherPy Report.pdf_**

# VacationPy
## Following WeatherPy, a Data Scientist's quest for a perfect vacation spot. 
 * Perfect weather conditions: (a) 70F < Max Temperature < 80F (b) Wind speed < 10mpH and (c) Zero Cloudiness
 * **_gmaps_** and **_Google Places API_** was used in this study
 * **_Heat map_** of all the cities (more than 500) was created with Humidity as "weight" parameter
 * **_Hotels_** nearest to selected cities were obtained by making calls to **_places API_** and displayed in a map with markers
 * Top three **_Natural features_** closest to selected cities were obtained and displayed in a map 
 * Top three **_Points of Interest_** in the vicinity of the selected cities were obtained and displayed in a map 
 * Maps are saved as .png file in **_Images_** folder
 * A report of the study is available as **_VacationPy Report.pdf_**
